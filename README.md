# React Boilerplate

## Description

---

This React.js boilerplate is based on create-react-app (typescript). We use a custom ESLint and Babel config alongside a simple prettier config. We also use Carco along TailwindCss and PostCss for handling the styling.
For testing, you can either use the react-testing-library or the more advanced Cypress library.
For Code documentation you can set up JSDoc to generate either a static HTML or a markdown overview of your codebase. Happy Coding !
